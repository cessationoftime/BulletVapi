Misc. Notes: 


One can view the output of the compiler from within monodevelop, open the errors window and click the "Build Output" button.

If one adds a new Package library and gets and Error "foo/bar.h file not found" one needs to install the actual development library on the PC using "sudo apt-get install xxx"

If one adds a new Package library and gets an Error "undefined reference to a function" then one needs to use the appropriate -X compiler option to reference the needed library, for example: "-X -lglut".  One can add this compiler option to the monodevelop compiler options.  Project >> "Project Name" options >> Build>Code Generation > Extra Compiler Options
